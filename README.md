Some worm effects:

* Jump: A worm is immune to colliding with any worm (i.e., bodies and heads). (This is sometimes called invincible, invisible)
* Wallhack: A worm is immune to colliding with the map. When a worm is intersecting with a map, the intersecting part of the worm is present at the opposite side of the map (i.e., a worm can go "through" the map).
